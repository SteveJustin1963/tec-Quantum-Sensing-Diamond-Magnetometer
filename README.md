## Magnetometers ordinary
are sensors that measure the strength and direction of a magnetic field.

## Quantum magnetometer 
is a scientific instrument that uses quantum phenomena to measure magnetic fields. Quantum magnetometers can be highly sensitive and can detect extremely small magnetic fields, making them useful for a variety of scientific and technical applications. There are several different types of quantum magnetometers, including SQUID magnetometers, NV center magnetometers, and atomic magnetometers. Each type of magnetometer uses a different physical process to detect magnetic fields, but they all rely on the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve their high sensitivity. One example of a quantum magnetometer is an AC magnetometer, which measures the intensity of an alternating current (AC) magnetic field. AC magnetometers typically consist of two sensors that respond to the two components of an AC magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of the tool. These sensors can be fluxgate magnetometers, which use the phenomenon of magnetic flux quantization to measure the magnetic field, or other types of sensors based on different physical principles. Another example of a quantum magnetometer is a tool that uses fluxgate magnetometers to measure the earth's magnetic field. This type of magnetometer typically consists of two fluxgate magnetometers that measure the two components of the earth's magnetic field perpendicular to the tool axis. The outputs of these magnetometers can be used to determine the intensity and direction of the earth's magnetic field at a given location.


## SQUID
A SQUID magnetometer is a type of scientific instrument that is used to measure extremely small magnetic fields. SQUID stands for "Superconducting Quantum Interference Device," and it is based on the principles of superconductivity and quantum mechanics. it consists of a superconducting loop that is interrupted by a pair of Josephson junctions. The junctions are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields, and they can be used to measure fields as small as a few femtotesla (10^-15 tesla). To use it, place the sample measured in the magnetometer's sensing volume, which is the region of space where the device can detect magnetic fields. It then measures the magnetic field at the sample and provides an output signal that is proportional to the field strength....are widely used in a variety of scientific and technical applications, including geophysics, biology, materials science, and medical imaging. They are particularly useful for measuring weak magnetic fields that are difficult to detect with other types of instruments.

## Quantum-Sensing Diamond Magnetometer (QSDM) 
is a type of quantum magnetometer that uses a diamond crystal as the sensing element. The diamond crystal is embedded with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which are defects in the crystal lattice that can be used as quantum sensors. One of the key features of the QSDM is that it can operate at room temperature, unlike many other types of quantum magnetometers that require cryogenic cooling. This makes the QSDM more practical and easier to use in a wide range of applications. The QSDM can detect extremely small magnetic fields, down to the picotesla (10^-12 tesla) range. It has a wide dynamic range and can measure both static and dynamic magnetic fields. The QSDM also has a high spatial resolution, making it useful for imaging applications.

## For computing
Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond crystals have unique properties that make them suitable for use in diamond quantum sensors. These sensors use the spin state of the NV centers, which can be manipulated using microwave or magnetic field techniques, as well as the photoluminescent properties of the NV centers, which allow them to emit light when excited by certain wavelengths of light, to detect changes in the spin state and measure the intensity of magnetic fields or other physical quantities. In the field of quantum computing, diamonds are used as a platform for producing and detecting single photons, which are individual particles of light. These single photons can be used as qubits, the basic units of information in a quantum computer, and are also needed in applications such as secure quantum communication schemes. Diamonds are particularly useful for this purpose because they can produce and detect single photons at room temperature, which is more practical and easier to implement than other methods that require cryogenic cooling.
