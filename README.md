What is a quantum magnetometer?
an instrument for measuring the intensity of magnetic fields, by utilizing quantum phenomena.

How does a diamond sensor work?
The NV centre is also photoluminescent: when lit with green light it will emit a red glow. Because the spin state of the NV centre determines how strongly the diamond fluoresces, scientists can use changes in brightness to monitor changes in the centre's spin state due to microwaves or a magnetic field.

How does magnetometer sensor work?
Two AC magnetometers respond to the two components of an AC magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of the tool, and two fluxgates measure the two components of the earth's magnetic field perpendicular to the tool axis.

How are diamonds used in quantum computing?
The tiny ring, carved from single crystal synthetic diamond, could be useful for producing and detecting single photons. The photons can be used as qubits in a quantum computer. Single photons are also needed in applications such as secure quantum communication schemes.
